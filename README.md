#### Part 1: Introduction to Virtualization Concepts

### Hypervisor
A hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines. There are two types of hypervisors:
- *Type 1*: Runs directly on the hardware (bare-metal hypervisor).
- *Type 2*: Runs on top of an existing operating system (hosted hypervisor).

### Virtual Machines (VMs)
A *Virtual Machine (VM)* is a virtualized environment that runs its own operating system. VMs are isolated from each other and from the host system, offering high-level isolation but consuming more resources.

### Containers
*Containers* are lightweight virtualized environments that share the host operating systemâ€™s kernel but run applications in isolated user spaces. Containers are faster to start and more resource-efficient compared to VMs.

__Key Differences Between VMs and Containers:__

| Virtual Machines  | Containers |
|---------------------|------------|
| Includes full OS, virtual hardware | Shares host OS kernel |
| Requires more resources | Lightweight |
| Strong isolation, each VM runs separately | Process-level isolation |
|  Slightly slower due to full OS overhead | Faster startup  |

_Multipass Shell access:_
Command:
``` 
sudo multipass shell teeming-imp
``` 
I created a file in the instance home directory and named it 'hello_world.txt'.
Now trying to read the file outside the instance using the cat command.

Command:
``` 
sudo multipass exec teeming-imp -- cat hello_world.txt
``` 
Result:

_Stop a Running Instance_

Command
``` 
sudo multipass stop teeming-imp
``` 

_Deleting Instance_
``` 
sudo multipass delete teeming-imp
sudo multipass list
``` 
Result:

_Cloud-init Experiment:_

created the *"cloud-init.yml"* file.

The config file will install some basic packeges and after successfully starting the instance it will return "Cloud-init is working!" from the welcome.txt file which will create after running the first time.

_Commnad:_

``` 
sudo multipass launch --name galib cloud-init --cloud-init cloud-init.yml
```

Accessed shell using

``` 
sudo multipass shell galib
```

Now checking if the user rafsan_cloud exist.
_command:_

``` 
cat /etc/passwd | grep rafsan_cloud
```

Verifying welcome.txt
``` 
sudo cat /home/rafsan_cloud/welcome.txt
``` 
_Result:_

Using sudo because the file was created by root and was accessable by rafsan_cloud.

Then mounted the folder on the host machine using:

```
sudo multipass mount ~/host_machine cloud-init:/home/ubuntu/shared_folder

Creating a test file in the host machine.

echo "Hello from the host!" > ~/shared-folder/hostfile.txt
```
